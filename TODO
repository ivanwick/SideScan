- Change PacketStream so that it emits packets with the right datalink type,
  since this can be obtained via a call to
    int pcap_datalink(pcap_t *a)
    
- Change identifiers associated with PacketStream including the name of the
  class itself.
  
- Figure out whenever an int is being used, whether it would be more appropriate
  to use NSInteger or NSUInteger.
  
- Change initializers in the Packet class hierarchy to take advantage of late
  binding and dynamic typing, i.e. it may be possible for a direct init from
  PcapPacket to PacketTCP and passing self, instead of initializing temporary
  objects all the way down from PacketIP, PacketDatalink etc. (??)
  
+ Add methods to PacketIP for getting NSHost for src and dst address instead of
  a struct in_addr.
  
- Figure out the state of the TrafficAnalyzer code.
  Complete the TrafficAnalyzer class and debug.
